Task1

We need to apply Affine Transformations on a real-time video using Laptop’s camera, where every image
in the video is transformed using 3 transformations.

a) Rotation by 90 degrees counter clock-wise Key R for Rotation
b) Shearing in the X axis Key H for Shearing
c) Reflection on the Y-axis Key L for Reflection
d) q for quite




Task2


Video Filtering and Tranformation :
Given a noisy video, you are required to read and filter the video frames using 3x3 Average Filter.
a) The Average Filter kernel
Save the first 10 filtered frames using average filter in a folder named ’AvgFilter_ImgSeq’.
You can use the cv2.VideoCapture function to read the video file
b) Pixel Point Processing Tranformation
After saving the first 10 filtered images, you have to apply pixel point transformation on them using
the aforementioned equation, where f() is a grey level transformation function, P’ is the processed
image pixel value and p refers to the original image pixel value.
Save the 10 transformed frames in a folder named ’PixelTranform_ImgSeq’.
